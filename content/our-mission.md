St Albans Community Preschool is a positive and nurturing environment.  We encourage children to learn and grow by recognising and supporting each child’s individuality, curiosity, cooperation, independence, and creativity. The children’s exploration is guided and supported by qualified, experienced teachers whose curriculum engages family and whanau. 

We are responsive to the strengths, interests and learning needs of each child.  We document the children’s work and experiences to inspire the sharing of information among teachers, family members, and peers. We seek open communication with parents and whanau in order to match families’ aspirations for the children with our learning programmes. We acknowledge the unique place of Maori as tangata whenua and the partnership inherent in Te Tiriti O Waitangi and see to provide equitable learning opportunities for all.
